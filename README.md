This is terci written in html5. I can't say that it is very functional. But it has a change of themes. Button to start and pause.
All inkstrutsiya is already on the page index.html
Several bugs were noticed:
1) If you quickly rotate the pieces they jump to the top
2) Line where the end of the round, sometimes jumping
3) Audio may not always play correctly in all browsers
